# Dark Mountains
The northern region of the Realm is a dark jagged mountain range.  There are mysterious red and blue crystals found in a few locations.  [[Bosses#Ignax, the Red Dragon|Ignax, the Red Dragon]], has claimed a series of caves as his home just under [[Ignax Spire|the bright red spire]].  The area around the red spire is laced with magma pools and rifts. A large [[Glacier]] shifts slowly south from north.
