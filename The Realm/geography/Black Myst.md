# Black Myst

The Blacky Myst was created is a boundary created when the Pocket Realm was created.  It is meant to keep people inside where it is 'safe'. However if a person knows the pattern they may use the Black Myst to return to their home land.  Some adventurers have found their way out but have not shared the secret with anyone.

If a person enters the Black Myst they cannot return the way they came.  After the third day, the Black Myst will kill the unescaped creature.
