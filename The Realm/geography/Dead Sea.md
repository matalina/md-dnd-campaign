# Dead Sea

The Dead Sea once was a wide blue ocean upon which the [[Pirates of the Deep]] once ruled.  The ocean dried up upon the creation of the Realm crashing the ship into the earth and the pirates became bandits.

A [[Bosses#The Great Phoenix|phoenix]] now has a lair near the [[Dark Mountains]].
