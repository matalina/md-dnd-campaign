# Cavern of Time

The Caverns of Time is a network of caves that leads to a cavern with two portals.

One portal is a two way door and only [[NPCs#The Traveling Merchant, Melath Shaeremae|Traveling Merchant]] has the key to open the portal.

One portal opens at various intervals releasing various monsters at various levels depending on how many adventurers are actively seeking adventures.
