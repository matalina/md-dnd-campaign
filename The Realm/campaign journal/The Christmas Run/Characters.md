## The Chosen

### Vi

Patron: Hadar
Background: Assassin

#### Hadar
aka The Dark Hunger (star like Elder evil from the far realm)
Hadar didn't have a fixed place in the sky but instead danced and wavered across Realmspace
Hadar was a cinder-red star, barely visible in the night sky.

Hadar sends avatars to the mortal plane and tries to draw power in order to survive longer
They're primarily driven by fear of Hadar's wrath and their own greed as none of them want to lose their magic.
He can communicate telepathically to his patrons and followers across galaxies
