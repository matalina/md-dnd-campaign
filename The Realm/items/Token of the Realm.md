# Token of the Realm

The Token of the [[World Tree]] is an instrument that keeps adventures in the pocket realm.  Each token creates a unique pocket dimension room for the user to utilize.

Token's are sentient items with distinct personalities, values and goals.

If the attuned creature obliges the token with any of its values or goals the token gains happiness and increases in power.  Failure to do so can result in conflict with the attuned creature and the sentient token.

## Token Levelx

Tokens gain levels by the attuned create keeping the token happy.  A creature must cater to the tokens whims, personality in order to make it happy.  The DM ultimately decides what the token likes or doesn't like.  During game play the DM will keep a tally of pluses and minuses to the token's happiness. If the net worth is positive a +1 to the happiness will be granted.  If negative a -1 will be applied.  Certain events if they happen can cause the token to immediately lose or gain happiness.
