# Get Started

## Character Creation

All characters must have a [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) Character sheet.  You may choose any type of character you'd like as long as it can be created on D&D Beyond is public.  You are free to use whatever the DM has purchased and shared with [the campaign](https://ddb.ac/campaigns/join/3339438553531512).

### D&D Beyond Character Builder Settings

Must have settings on character creation:
* XP Leveling
* Manual Hit points
* Feat prerequisites
* Multiclass requirements
* Use Encumbrance
* Ignore Coin weight
* Public Character
Optional settings:
* Optional Class Features can be used
* Can Customize your Origin if you like

### Ability Scores

To create ability scores choose Manual/Rolled Abilities.

Roll 4d6 removing the lowest die.  Do this six times.  You may roll a second group of dice the same way and use one or the other group to assign ability scores.

### Character Personalities

Instead of Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds and Flaws pick or roll from these options and add them to your Personality Traits or Notes section. You may of course pick these as well.
