# House Rules

* If the DM has access to feature/character at D&D Beyond you may use it with in reason
* The Character creation rules have been stated in the [[Getting Started]] section
* If you are attuned to a Token and have the Warlock Patron of Genie, your bottle abilities will instead be the token's pocket dimension, all other Patron abilities including the level in which you gain the abilities remains the same, only the location of the pocket dimension changes.
* If there is a subclass you wish to use please discuss it with the DM beforehand and we can work on getting it into the game and/or an alternative.
