You were chosen at random by the Gods of the Multiverse to compete in a trial of wits and bravery. The gods kidnapped you from your life and thrust you into a new world where the exit is only but rumored and any who have found it have not shared the secrets with anyone. Some adventures die in the realm of trials, others choose to live their immortal lives out seeking their own goals instead of living by the rules of the gods. Some brave adventures make that one way trip all on their own with no way back except to win the favor of a God and seek release. What will you choose to do with your new life?
