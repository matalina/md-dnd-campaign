## Features

**Core Features** are always gained in the 1st or 2nd level of the class (2nd if it’d make a powerful feature for multiclassing) and it defines the class. I discussed these up with your mechanical identity, they’re the things that will be relevant in every combat, all the way through every tier of play. 

_Core Feature Examples: Wild Shape (Druid), Rage (Barbarian), Martial Arts (Monk), Font of Magic (Sorcerer) Action Surge (Fighter)._

**Rock Features** have a lot of variety but generally these are features that sit a step below your core features but provide abilities or solid enhancements to a character that are relevant at least in the tier they are gained. These are the rocks that can tip the scales one way or the other on how powerful a class is. They can be combat features, an additional die roll, condition or damage resistances, strong roleplay or exploration abilities, or anything else that provides an option or capability in play. Generally, by the time a class reaches 7th level, it should have at least one offensive rock feature, a defensive rock feature, and a utility rock feature (for full spellcasters this can all just be spellcasting or features that grant additional spells).

Also, just because I've seen some designers make this mistake, don't give classes resistances to bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage, (barbarians already have that niche) and it can throw off a lot of math.

_Rock Feature Examples: Feral Instinct (Barbarian), Indomitable (Fighter), Stunning Strike (Monk), Aura of Protection (Paladin), Arcane Recovery (Wizard)._

**Upgrade Features** improve a previous core or rock feature to make it more relevant in later tiers of play. This can sometimes be flat modifiers, a source of bonus damage to attack rolls, a bonus to the number of uses of a feature, or an enhanced attribute of a previous feature. Usually, you’ll see these at tier thresholds like levels 5-6, 10-11, and 16-17. It's good to use these as an opportunity to counter threats players are likely to encounter at the next tier, such as turning martial character's attacks magical to overcome resistances to non-magical weapons.

_Upgrade Feature Examples: Extra Attack (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger), Uncanny Dodge (Rogue), Improved Divine Smite (Paladin)._

**Ribbon Features** are the minor features that usually provide some minor ability, roleplay features, or bonuses to rarer situations or ability checks. They may not even come up once in an adventure. Think of these as the colorful decorations for your class that round it out stylistically and thematically.

_Ribbon Examples: Timeless Body (A Druid and Monk Ability), Countercharm (Bard), Divine Health (Paladin), Destroy Undead (Cleric)._

**Capstone Features** come in at 20th level as a sort of reward for playing a class to the end. Sadly, very few games ever actually play to 20th level so they’re really more of a carrot on the end of a stick. They usually integrate the core features and should be VERY strong. Just don’t go too game breaking as there will be the odd few games that actually hit level 20 and keep going.


## Scoring

Tally up the point costs of the following features:
+3 for half-caster.
+6 for full-caster and pact-caster.
+1 for prepared spellcaster.
+1 for ritual spellcaster.
+0.5 for d8 hit dice.
+1 for d10 hit dice.
+1.5 for d12 hit dice.
+0.5 for heavy armor.
+0.5 for shields.
+0.5 for all martial weapons.
+0.5 for thieves’ tools.
+0.5 per skill proficiencies beyond two.
+1 point per Rock Feature, including ASIs, Spellcasting, Upgrade Features and Capstones.

If your end result is between 20 and 25 points (including the points gained from archetype features) then you’re in the right ballpark. When in doubt, take a look at the most similar option from the class list and see how it stacks up in things like AC, custom skills, and average damage output against the basic classes.
